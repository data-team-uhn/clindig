# ClinDIG
## Documentation
This is where some text will go regarding how to build CARDS in a way where the correct project is built out of this repo.

These instructions will also describe requirements around a CanDIGv2 instance is running and how one would modify the code to point CARDS at CanDIG. Alternatively, this may be a description describing the interaction between the two systems


## Code/Download
- [CanDIG v2](https://github.com/CanDIG/CanDIGv2)
- [CARDS](https://github.com/data-team-uhn/cards/)

## Factsheet
ClinDIG integrates two software platforms: CanDIG and CARDS to create a rich clinical and genomic data management solution that enables federated analysis while protecting patient privacy.

## Provenance
New features and bug fixes are tested and released into the development branch upon completion. Releases are created by combining a number of features into a single release tag, upon which release notes will be updated. During development, pull requests are reviewed and validated by the development team before being merged into the development branch. All ClinDIG releases will be approved by DATA Team leadership.
