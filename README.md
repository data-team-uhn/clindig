# ClinDIG

## Factsheet
ClinDIG integrates two software platforms: CanDIG and CARDS to create a rich clinical and genomic data management solution that enables federated analysis while protecting patient privacy. CanDIG offers a suite of federation services to enable privacy-protected clinical and phenotypic data sharing and research across multiple sites. CARDS offers a data management platform that can be configured for your own needs, integrating a UI for questionnaire development, connection to numerous ontologies for data structure, and a patient-facing questionnaire UI for direct data capture.
