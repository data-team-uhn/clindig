# ClinDIG
## Documentation

## Factsheet
ClinDIG integrates two software platforms: CanDIG and CARDS to create a rich clinical and genomic data management solution that enables federated analysis while protecting patient privacy.

## Provenance
New features and bug fixes are tested and released into the development branch upon completion. Releases are created by combining a number of features into a single release tag, upon which release notes will be updated. During development, pull requests are reviewed and validated by the development team before being merged into the development branch. All ClinDIG releases will be approved by DATA Team leadership.
