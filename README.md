# ClinDIG

## Factsheet
ClinDIG integrates two software platforms: CanDIG and CARDS to create a rich clinical and genomic data management solution that enables federated analysis while protecting patient privacy. CanDIG offers a suite of federation services to enable privacy-protected clinical and phenotypic data sharing and research across multiple sites. CARDS offers a data management platform that can be configured for your own needs, integrating a UI for questionnaire development, connection to numerous ontologies for data structure, and a patient-facing questionnaire UI for direct data capture. 

## Documentation
This is where some text will go regarding how to build CARDS in a way where the correct project is built out of this repo.

These instructions will also describe requirements around a CanDIGv2 instance is running and how one would modify the code to point CARDS at CanDIG. Alternatively, this may be a description describing the interaction between the two systems


## Code/Download
If you'd like to access the code to the platforms this project brought together as separate entities, please visit:
- [CanDIG v2](https://github.com/CanDIG/CanDIGv2)
- [CARDS](https://github.com/data-team-uhn/cards/)

## Provenance
New features and bug fixes are tested and released into the development branch upon completion. Releases are created by combining a number of features into a single release tag, upon which release notes will be updated. During development, pull requests are reviewed and validated by the development team before being merged into the development branch. All ClinDIG releases will be approved by DATA Team leadership.
